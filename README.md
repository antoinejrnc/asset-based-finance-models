# Aviation Finance Models

This repository contains two original, professional-grade financial models developed to reflect industry-standard practices in aviation finance, asset valuation, and credit risk analysis.

The project was completed independently and is intended to demonstrate applied financial modelling, valuation judgment, and risk analysis skills at a level relevant for graduate study in finance and investment analysis.

## 1. Aircraft Asset Valuation Model (Excel)

### Objective
To value a single commercial aircraft using a discounted cash flow (DCF) framework consistent with practices used by aircraft lessors, structured finance teams, and investment committees.

### Key Features
- Aircraft-level DCF valuation with explicit lease cash flows and terminal residual value
- Transparent and fully editable assumptions
- Economic depreciation framework reflecting age, utilisation, and market dynamics
- Base, downside, and stress residual value scenarios
- Explicit WACC construction and sensitivity analysis
- Lease Rate Factor (LRF) calibration consistent with market benchmarks
- Clean valuation waterfall producing NPV and IRR outputs

### Files
- `Aircraft_Valuation_Model.xlsx` – fully functional valuation model
- `Aircraft_Valuation_Methodology.pdf` – modelling logic, assumptions, and interpretation of results

## 2. Airline Bankruptcy Risk Model (Python)

### Objective
To assess relative airline financial health and default risk using ratio analysis, scoring methodology, and macroeconomic stress testing.

### Methodology
- Data ingestion and preprocessing using pandas
- Liquidity, leverage, profitability, efficiency, and solvency ratios
- Transparent scoring and ranking framework
- Base, downside, and severe stress scenarios
- Visualisation of results and comparative risk profiles

### Files
- `Airline_Default_Risk_Model.ipynb` – fully commented Jupyter notebook

Airline financial data used in the analysis is sourced from publicly available financial statements.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Financial modelling and valuation (DCF, IRR, sensitivity analysis)
- Credit and bankruptcy risk assessment
- Applied use of Python for financial analysis
- Scenario design and stress testing
- Clear financial documentation and communication

## Notes
All assumptions are explicitly stated in the models. The work is original and intended for academic and demonstrative purposes.
